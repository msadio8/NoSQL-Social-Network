# NoSQL : Social Network API

## Description

We build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. we use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.jsLinks to an external site. and MongooseLinks to an external site. packages, we also use a JavaScript date library of our  choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

This is a back end application for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts and create a friend list.
